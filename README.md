This repo contains the resources (**Code**, **Data**, **Models**) for the paper "Laser: Learn to Reason Efficiently with Adaptive Length-based Reward Shaping"

Laser (**L**ength-b**A**sed **S**t**E**p **R**eward shaping) and its adaptive versions Laser-D, Laser-DE ( **Dynamic** and **D**ifficulty-aware **L**ength-b**A**sed **S**t**E**p **R**eward shaping) are three novel methods to successfully improve both the effectiveness and efficiency of reasoning. Laser-D and Laser-DE achieve a **6.1** improvement on AIME2024 while reducing token usage by **63\%**.

## News

- :fire: [05/2025] We are excited to release the resources for the paper "Laser: Learn to Reason Efficiently with Adaptive Length-based Reward Shaping"

## Introduction

In Laser, we propose a **unified view** for length-based reward shaping, unifying various reward-shaping and truncation methods. Building on this view, we propose a novel **L**ength-b**A**sed **S**t**E**p **R**eward shaping method (**Laser**), which employs a step reward function based on target length. We further propose the adaptive version of Laser, **Laser-D** and **Laser-DE**, based on two key intuitions: 

1. The reasoning behavior of the model evolves dynamically during training, necessitating reward specifications that are also adaptive and dynamic; 

2. Rather than uniformly encouraging shorter or longer chains of thought (CoT), we posit that length-based reward shaping should be difficulty-aware i.e., it should penalize lengthy CoTs more for easy queries. 

This approach facilitates a combination of fast and slow thinking, leading to a better overall tradeoff. Unlike methods that improve token efficiency at the expense of accuracy, our proposed approaches deliver substantial gains in both dimensionsâ€”even on the challenging AIME2024 benchmark.

### Unified Framework for Length-based Reward Shaping

We propose a unified framework for length-based reward shaping, unifying various reward-shaping and truncation methods. More details can be found in our [paper](), section 4.

## Performance

### Efficacy-Efficiency Trade-off
Efficacy (accuracy) and efficiency (token efficiency) are actually two conflicting goals. The goal of RL-based CoT compression should be to find a better balance between the two and improve both.

Each point in the following figures represents an independent experiment, obtained through different training runs with different parameter configurations. Benchmarks consist of MATH500, AIME2024, AMC2023, and Olympiad Bench.

## How to Start :running:?
### Installation

```bash
conda create -n laser python=3.10
git clone https://github.com/hkust-nlp/Laser.git

pip install -r requirement.txt
pip install flash-attn==2.6.3 --no-build-isolation
pip install -e . --no-dependencies
```

### Data Preparation

```bash
python scripts/pull_from_hub.py --repo_id hkust-nlp/Laser-Deepscaler-Dataset --local_path ./data/deepscaler --repo_type dataset --ignore_patterns "global_step*"
```

or you can download the dataset from [ðŸ¤— HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hkust-nlp/Laser-Deepscaler-Dataset) and put it in the `data/deepscaler` folder.

### Training

If you use slurm to run the training with ray, you can use the following command:

```bash
bash scripts/example/ray_start_slurm.sh $SCRIPT

# e.g. bash scripts/example/ray_start_slurm.sh scripts/training/laser-de-1.5b/laser-de-1.5B-l4096.sh
```

Otherwise, you can use the following command to run the training with ray:
```bash
bash scripts/example/ray_start_sh.sh $SCRIPT
```

SCRIPT is the script you want to run, for example, `scripts/training/laser-de-1.5b/laser-de-1.5B-l4096.sh`.
```bash
# Laser
scripts/training/laser-1.5b/laser-1.5b-l2048.sh
scripts/training/laser-1.5b/laser-1.5b-l4096.sh
scripts/training/laser-1.5b/laser-1.5b-l8192.sh

# Laser-D
scripts/training/laser-d-1.5b/laser-d-1.5b-l1024.sh
scripts/training/laser-d-1.5b/laser-d-1.5b-l2048.sh
scripts/training/laser-d-1.5b/laser-d-1.5b-l4096.sh

# Laser-DE
scripts/training/laser-de-1.5b/laser-de-1.5b-l1024.sh
scripts/training/laser-de-1.5b/laser-de-1.5b-l2048.sh
scripts/training/laser-de-1.5b/laser-de-1.5b-l4096.sh
```

### Evaluation
